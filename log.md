# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days Of Code by forking the repo. Yay me.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to commit to this--it's just what I need. I will be setting aside at least an hour a day (no school time included). I hope to work on a balance of freeCodeCamp, personal, and potentially school related projects.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
